          <h1>African Digital art</h1>
          <p>
            For African digital art I would like to use my essay that speaks
            about how to create new African content as it presents the argument
            of the double-edged sword that sharing African content has.
          </p>
          <p>The Role of the Afropolitan</p>
          <p>How to Create New African Content</p>

            Afropolitan deals with the identification of African people and the
            complexity of it because of the experiences of African people and
            the many African nations to which people belong to more than one of
            them (Ede, 2016). Afropolitanism is a huge range of &lsquo;cultural
            complexity while taking into consideration the history that resulted
            in &ldquo;blackness&rdquo; as well as not allowing people&rsquo;s
            identities to be simplified to what is considered &lsquo;to be
            African or of African descent (Knudsen, 2016). Achille Mbembe
            describes Afropolitanism as &lsquo;the presence of elsewhere in the
            here&rsquo; due to colonialization and the movement of people in and
            out of Africa, both Black and non-Black.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many forms of visual media recognized worldwide such as
            &ldquo;Hollywood films&rdquo; (American media), &lsquo;French
            artists&rsquo;, and &ldquo;Anime&rdquo; from Japan. While these are
            very popular there is very little recognition for Nollywood, the 2
            <sup>nd</sup> largest film industry in the world (Bright, 2015).
            Despite being financially successful and producing content
            constantly, Nollywood is often overlooked.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Nollywood</h2>
          </p>
          <p>
            Nollywood is the name of the Nigerian video film industry. As
            mentioned above, it has become incredibly successful in recent
            years. Despite Nollywood booming in the industry, I still feel that
            the content is not taken seriously and is often mocked. As seen in
            social media, the videos that go viral are often Nollywood from
            years ago creating a preconceived notion about the films. This has
            also allowed the movies to reach a niche audience that helps support
            the filmmakers. An example of a video that helped expose Nollywood
            to more people, is the infamous &ldquo;Why are you running?&rdquo;
            viral meme.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src={WAUR}></img>
            Figure 1 This is a screenshot of the video that is often used as a
            meme on its own the show 'Pretty Liars1'(2014). As you can see the
            low resolution adds to the preconceived idea that Nollywood
            isn&rsquo;t good quality in terms of film.{" "}

            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The filmmakers have become more innovative and have gained massive
            support for their artworks and are transforming the digital global
            market (Ebelebe, 2019). This is because the experiences of Nollywood
            filmmakers, storytellers and creators are often compared to
            Westernized/American views even though Nollywood is meant to combat
            the stereotypical ideas and Western gaze that the world has on
            Africa (Schnell, 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at Nigeria specifically, Nollywood portrays Afropolitan
            experiences in its films. This therefore can be seen as something
            relatable outside of Nigeria and to everyone who identifies as
            Afropolitan (Green-Simms. 2020). The continent shares themes while
            also talking specifically about Lagos, Nigeria. For example, movies
            like <em>Lion Heart </em>about a woman taking over the business from
            her ill father could be relatable across the continent while also
            having individual experiences personal to being from Nigeria, the
            movie was nominated for an Oscar but was disqualified(Michael
            Martin, 2019). While movies like <em>93 Days </em>are personal to
            Nigeria because it deals with the lives of Lagos people and having
            to save them from an Ebola outbreak, the Ebola outbreak occurred in
            other countries as well.

            <h2>Sourcing content from Africa</h2>
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is sourcing content from Africa so important? When I introduced
            Nollywood, I referenced Breanne Schnell and their claims that
            Nollywood is meant to go against Western views of Africa. The fact
            that Nollywood is compared to Hollywood is a very big reason why
            sourcing content from Africa is important. Looking at the whole of
            Africa, when other countries&rsquo; movies are made using African
            countries, they are often a story about a white person&rsquo;s
            experiences in Africa and will most probably include some type of
            wild animal. For example, the movie &lsquo;<em>Born Free&rsquo;</em>
            , was made by a company in the United Kingdom and filmed in Kenya.
            Not only do Western films only focus on the wildlife of Africa they
            also often romanticise colonisation like in the movie &lsquo;
            <em>Out of Africa&rsquo;.</em>
          </p>

            Despite using Africa constantly for film locations, there are hardly
            any stories told about the experiences of African people in Africa.
            This is why recognising the success of Nollywood is vital. The
            filmmakers are constantly making unique stories and breaking
            stereotypes to share their experiences as well as showcasing there
            is more to Africa than what is seen on screen. As Repetti (2007)
            said, despite the globalisation and creolization of culture where
            you experience European, Asian, and American societies, African
            culture is scarcely included unless it is to tell the same stories
            as before and use spirituality in different African cultures to
            portray witchcraft. Through Afropoliticsm, you can see the
            importance of sourcing from Africa and using African content. The
            fact that there is a combination of cultures, shows there is a
            variety of content that can be shared across the continent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, Afropolitan allows people to define themselves
            however they decide regardless of what is considered &lsquo;to be
            African&rsquo; as well as defining the idea of
            &lsquo;Blackness&rsquo; for themselves. Nollywood is a huge industry
            that is extremely financially successful, however, the content is
            not taken seriously by many people despite them being nominated for
            Oscars and receiving high critic scores. Unfortunately,
            Nollywood&rsquo;s progress through the years is not recognised and
            &lsquo;normal&rsquo; people are only experiencing the old Nollywood.
            Due to its popularity, there has been growth and improvement for
            Nigerian Filmmakers. Africa has a&nbsp; vast variety of content to
            be shared with the world, there needs to be a deconstruction of the
            stereotypes and prejudices against African content that exists in
            Western media. With the growth of Nollywood, the use of African
            content grows further and the exitance of Afropoliticsm allows for
            the stories from Nollywood alone, to be relatable and have a
            continent-wide influence.
